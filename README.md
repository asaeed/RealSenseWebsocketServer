# RealSenseWebsocketServer
C# App using RealSense SDK and Fleck for WebSockets to send data to web clients

Note: RealSense SDK's Javascript support is broken in current release (8.0.24.6528).  This is a workaround which may have the benefit of being able to crunch data faster before its sent to the browser.
